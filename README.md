News-scraper is a node application that allows a user to pull up articles and be able to scrap data through line commands.
The data is saved with mongoDB after being scraped.

This app uses technologies such as mongodb, express, cheerio to scrape, as well as axios to get the data neccessary.

This has also been deployed to heroku at: https://news---scrap.herokuapp.com/
although pulling up the articles seems to possible trying to load too much at once, thus causing it to take a long time. I am looking into solving this issue and updating this repository once I do so.
